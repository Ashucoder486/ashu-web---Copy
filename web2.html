<h2>overview</h2>
<P>Chandragupta Maurya (350-295 BCE) was the first emperor of the Mauryan Empire in Ancient India. He extensively expanded the Kingdom of Magadha and founded the Maurya dynasty. He reigned from 320 BCE to 298 BCE. The Magadhan kingdom expanded under the Mauryas to become an empire that reached its peak under the reign of his grandson, Ashoka, from 268 BCE to 231 BCE. The exact nature of the polity in Chandragupta's time is under certain. The Mauryan empire was loose-knit.

        Chandragupta Maurya was an important figure in the history of India, who laid the foundations of the first state that united most of India. Chandragupta, under the tutelage of Chanakya, created a new empire based on the principles of statecraft, built a large army, and continued expanding the boundaries of his empire until ultimately renouncing it for an ascetic life in his final years.
        
        Prior to his consolidation of power, Alexander the Great had invaded the North-West Indian subcontinent before abandoning his campaign in 324 BCE due to a mutiny caused by the prospect of facing another large empire, presumably the Nanda Empire. Chandragupta defeated and conquered both the Nanda Empire and the Greek satraps that were appointed or formed from Alexander's Empire in South Asia. He set out to conquer the Nanda Empire centered in Pataliputra, Magadha. Afterwards, Chandragupta expanded and secured his western border, where he was confronted by Seleucus I Nicator in the Seleucid Mauryan war. After two years of war, Chandragupta was considered to have gained the upper hand in the conflict and annexed satrapies up to the Hindu Kush. Instead of prolonging the war, both parties settled on a marriage treaty between Chandragupta and Seleucus I Nicator's daughter Helena.
        
        Chandragupta's empire extended throughout most of the Indian subcontinent, spanning from modern day Bengal to Afghanistan across North India as well as making inroads into Central and South India. Contemporary Greek evidence states that Chandragupta did not give up performing the rites of sacrificing animals associated with Vedic Brahminism, an ancient form of Hinduism; he delighted in hunting and otherwise leading a life remote from the Jain practice of Ahimsa or nonviolence towards living beings. Chandragupta's reign, and the Maurya Empire, set an era of economic prosperity, reforms, infrastructure expansions, and tolerance. Many religions thrived within his realms and his descendants' empire. Buddhism, Jainism and Ājīvika gained prominence alongside Vedic and Brahmanistic traditions, and minority religions such as Zoroastrianism and the Greek pantheon were respected. A memorial for Chandragupta Maurya exists on the Chandragiri hill along with a seventh-century hagiographic inscription.</P>
		<p>Chandragupta Maurya, also known to the Greeks as Sandrakottos or Sandrokottos, was the founder and the first ruler of the Maurya Dynasty and is credited with establishing the first pan-Indian empire. He established a vast centralised empire with the help of his mentor and later minister Chanakya or Kautilya, the details of whose functioning, culture, military, and economy are well preserved in Kautilya's Arthashastra. The Mauryan dynasty was established by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BC. He defeated the last Nanda ruler with the help of Kautilya and established the Mauryan empire. Chandragupta, along with Bindusara and Ashoka, glorified the Mauryan empire and also ancient India. They were able to control entire north India, including the Gangetic valley, thus achieving political unity. Earlier, there was a republican and oligarchical form of government, and Mauryans replaced it with a monarchy. They established their capital at Pataliputra, also known as Patna, which is in the current day's Bihar. 


The life and achievements of Chandragupta are represented in ancient and historical Greek, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts, though the details differ greatly. The historical sources that describe Chandragupta Maurya's life differ greatly in detail.


In this Chandragupta biography, we will study Chandragupta Maurya story of his early life, and as a ruler of the Mauryan empire, we will learn about Chandragupta Maurya kingdom, His date of death. The empire also contributed towards literature, art and architecture apart from bringing political unity

<h2>Chandragupta Maurya History About his Early Life</h2>
<list>
<li>Much about the Chandragupta Maurya time period and its origins are still unknown. The majority of what is known about him is based on legends and mythology rather than historical facts.</li>

<li>According to some records, Chandragupta Maurya was born in 340 BC in Pataliputra.</li>

<li>The only definite inscriptional reference to Chandragupta history is found in the Junagarh inscription from the 2nd century CE.</li>

<li>The social origins of Chandragupta history, especially his caste, are still disputed.</li>

<li>Different versions can be found in Buddhist, Jain, and ancient literary works. He is variously identified as a member of the Kshatriya Moriya clan ruling Pippalivahana on the present-day Indo-Nepal border, as a peacock-tamer, as the son of a woman named Mura, and even as being closely or distantly related to the Nandas.</li>

<li>As a result, historians disagree about his social roots. According to some historians, he seemed to have come from a common family and was not a prince but rather a commoner with no direct claim to the throne of Magadha.</li>

<li>Other historians say that he was a member of the Moriya or Maurya tribe, which had fallen on hard times by the 4th century BCE, and that Chandragupta grew up among peacock-tamers, herdsmen, and hunters.</li>

<li>He is referred to as a Kshatriya in Buddhist scriptures and mediaeval inscriptions. As a result, it is possible that he belonged to a Kshatriya or related caste, as the Brahmin Kautilya would not have selected him for rulership if he had not been a Kshatriya or related caste.</li>

<li>Even though he came from a modest family, Chandragupta didn't believe his upbringing had anything to do with his political ambitions. In any case, Chandragupta was almost certainly active in the pursuit of his goals as a young man, according to historical facts.</li>

<li>He was very ambitious from childhood and took advantage of the disrupting Nandas and defeated the last Nanda ruler Dhanananda with the help of Kautilya, and established the Mauryan dynasty.</li>

<li>North-west of India was under the control of Seleucus Nikater, Chandragupta defeated him, and In the treaty, he married the Daughter of Seleucus and also offered 500 elephants to him and united the north-west with the mainland of India. </li>

<li>He was a monarch and kept all the matters, especially those related to the polity, administration and military, in his hands. The impeccable finding of his kingdom is, they maintained an extraordinary and huge army. </li>
